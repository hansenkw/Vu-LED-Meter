# Vu-LED-Meter
This is a decorative LED that shines based on the audio input through the 3.5mm audio jack connector. The design is a 2-layer printed circuit board (PCB) based on Great Scott Vu LED Meter (https://www.instructables.com/Make-Your-Own-LED-Sign-VU-Meter/) with few modifications as seen below. 
  - Changed through-hole (THT) to surface-mounted (SMD) components, allowing space-effiecient design.
  - Designed a 12V-5V DCDC buck converter circuitry instead of using off the shelf module, integrated it with the rest of the circuitry into one PCB.
  - Utilized six (instead of seven) audio voltage references with each associated with a single row of LEDs.
  - Addeed current-limiting resistors to reduce current consumption.
